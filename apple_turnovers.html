        <P>Delicious, yet so easy to make. Anyone can do these classic apple turnovers!</P>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>4 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed</li>
            <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the lemon and 4 cups water in a large bowl. Place the sliced apples in the water to keep them from browning.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Drain water from apples, and place them into the hot skillet. Cook and stir for about 2 minutes. Add brown sugar, and cinnamon, and cook, stirring, for 2 more minutes. Stir together cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water. Pour into the skillet, and mix well. Cook for another minute, or until sauce has thickened. Remove from heat to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Unfold puff pastry sheets, and repair any cracks by pressing them back together. Trim each sheet into a square. Then cut each larger square into 4 smaller squares. Spoon apples onto the center of each squares. Fold over from corner to corner into a triangle shape, and press edges together to seal. Place turnovers on a baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch between them.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until turnovers are puffed and lightly browned. Cool completely before glazing.</li>
            <li>To make the glaze, mix together the confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla in a small bowl. Adjust the thickness by adding more sugar or milk if necessary. Drizzle glaze over the cooled turnovers.</li>
        </ol>
