        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe from my Gram who is English. She served this often, and I have modified her recipe for my family and this is it. A great alternative to Shepherd's Pie.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> large Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon herbes de Provence</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups frozen peas</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch deep-dish pie plate.</li>
            <li>Place potatoes into a pot; cover with salted water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover; simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain; mash with 2 tablespoons of the butter and the garlic. Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef, herbes de Provence, and nutmeg; cook and stir until beef is lightly brown and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Spread the beef evenly in the prepared pie plate. Cover evenly with the peas; spread the mashed potatoes over the peas. Dot the casserole with the remaining butter.</li>
            <li>Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until heated through and bubbly, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
